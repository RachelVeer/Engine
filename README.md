# Seacrest
While the repo name is opaque, I've grown fond of calling this project of mine **Seacrest**.
- *What is this?* It's my attempt to create a DirectX 12 Engine.
I've had multiple projects in the past that include OpenGL, and DirectX 11, thus I feel more confident in taking on a more "intimidating" API (i.e. DirectX 12) while complimenting what I love — game engines.

If you're curious to see what I'm up to - it's best to look through the **twoparadigms** branch, as I experiment there. 

Disclaimer: I'm by no means an expert, things are inspired by both the Hazel & Kohi engine — while adding my own flavors. Eitherway, if you want to run the project yourself feel free to recursively clone the twoparadigms branch, as it utilizes submodules. Then run the **GenerateProjects.bat** in the *scripts* folder.
